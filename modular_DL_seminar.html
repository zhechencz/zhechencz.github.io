<p>Friday 15:00-17:00 during the acadamic year 2017-2018</p>
  
<p>(Note that there is a graduate level course on modular rep thy of finite groups, lectured by Fei Xu, every Thursday 14:00-16:00 in the first term of the academic year, which should be very helpful for several parts of the seminar.)</p>
